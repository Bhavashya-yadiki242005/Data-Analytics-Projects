The majority of restaurants have ratings in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, suggesting generally positive customer experiences.

Couples most commonly prefer restaurants with an approximate cost of ₹300 for two people.

Restaurants offering online ordering tend to receive higher ratings compared to offline-only restaurants.

Cafés show a stronger preference for online orders, while dining restaurants rely more on offline customers.
