Amazon Sales Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel
## Project Overview

Microsoft Excel is a powerful and widely used tool for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data. This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to clean raw datasets, perform calculations, detect patterns, and present insights through charts and dashboards.

An Amazon sales dataset is used as a practical case study to apply Excel’s data analysis features such as formatting, formulas, conditional logic, pivot tables, and visualizations. The goal is to derive clear and actionable business insights from a large volume of product-level data.

## Objectives

Clean and format raw sales data for accurate analysis

Compute key business metrics such as average price and ratings

Identify top-rated, trending, and high-discount products

Extract meaningful attributes like brand names and review length

Visualize insights using multiple chart types

Build an interactive dashboard for summary reporting

Dataset Description

The dataset contains product-level information from Amazon, including:

Product ID and product name

Category

Actual price and discounted price

Discount percentage

Product ratings and rating count

Review content

The dataset requires preprocessing due to formatting issues, duplicate records, and inconsistent numeric representations.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset is cleaned and standardized before analysis:

Column headers are verified and corrected

Price and rating columns are converted to numeric formats

Blank cells are identified and handled appropriately

Duplicate product records are removed using product IDs

These steps ensure the dataset is consistent and reliable for calculations and visualization.

## Key Metrics and Calculations

Several business metrics are computed using Excel formulas:

Average discounted price

Total number of products

Average product rating

Discount amount per product

High-discount product flag

Review length calculation

Logical labels are created to identify:

Top-reviewed products

Trending products based on review count

## Feature Engineering

Additional attributes are derived to enhance analysis:

Brand name extracted from product name

Discount amount calculated from actual and discounted price

Review length computed from review text

Conditional formatting is applied to visually highlight highly rated products.

Data Visualization

## Multiple chart types are used to explore and communicate insights:

Column and bar charts for category comparisons

Line charts for trend analysis

Pie and doughnut charts for proportion analysis

Scatter and bubble charts to study relationships

Box plots to identify outliers and distribution spread

Combo charts to compare multiple metrics together

Area charts to highlight magnitude and variation

These visualizations help in understanding sales patterns and product performance.

Dashboard Creation

An interactive dashboard is built using:

Structured Excel tables

PivotTables for summarization

PivotCharts for dynamic visualization

The dashboard consolidates key metrics and charts into a single view, enabling quick decision-making and high-level analysis.

Key Insights

A small subset of products contributes significantly to customer engagement

Highly discounted products attract more attention but do not always guarantee higher ratings

Products with higher review counts tend to be more trustworthy to customers

Certain brands dominate specific categories

Price, discount, and rating relationships can be clearly observed through visual analysis
