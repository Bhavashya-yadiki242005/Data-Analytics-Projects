### Exploratory Data Analysis and Web Scraping Using Python
### Project Overview

This repository contains two data-driven projects that demonstrate the use of Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and web scraping. The projects focus on extracting meaningful insights from structured datasets and real-world web data using statistical analysis and visual exploration techniques.

These projects highlight practical skills in data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and data collection from online sources.

## Projects Included
## Exploratory Data Analysis on Wine Quality Dataset

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis on a wine quality dataset to understand the relationship between physicochemical properties and wine quality ratings.

# Objectives

Understand the structure and statistical properties of the dataset

Identify missing values, duplicates, and data distributions

Analyze wine quality patterns

Examine the relationship between alcohol content and wine quality

# Key Insights

Wine quality ratings are unevenly distributed

Alcohol content shows a noticeable influence on quality

Several features exhibit skewed distributions

Correlation analysis highlights key contributing variables

# Visualizations Used

Bar plots

Histograms and kernel density plots

Swarm plots

Pair plots

Violin plots

Box plots

Correlation heatmap

### Web Scraping and EDA on Quotes Dataset

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline starting from web scraping and followed by exploratory data analysis on the extracted data.

Quotes are scraped from a public website and analyzed to uncover patterns in authorship, tags, and textual characteristics.

Web Scraping Overview

Extracted quote text, author names, and associated tags

Implemented pagination handling for multi-page scraping

Prevented infinite loops during scraping

Stored extracted data in CSV format

## EDA Objectives

Analyze quote length distribution

Identify frequently occurring tags and themes

Explore textual patterns and author trends

## Key Insights

Certain tags appear more frequently, indicating dominant themes

Quote lengths vary significantly, reflecting diverse writing styles

Word cloud visualization highlights commonly used words

Visualizations Used

Word cloud

Histogram with kernel density estimation

Bar charts for tag frequency

## Technologies and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Requests

BeautifulSoup

WordCloud

## Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of exploratory data analysis workflows

Ability to transform raw data into actionable insights

Hands-on experience with real-world web data extraction

Improved data visualization and analytical thinking skills

Experience working with both numerical and text-based datasets
