### Bookstore Analytics Using SQL
## Project Overview

Bookstore analytics involves using data to understand customer preferences, product performance, inventory health, and marketing effectiveness in a retail bookstore. This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to build a complete analytics solution that answers real business questions such as:

Which books generate the most revenue?

Which customers are most valuable?

Which books are running low on stock?

Is marketing spend delivering a positive return?

Using a relational database and advanced SQL queries, this project transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

## Project Objectives

By completing this project, the following objectives are achieved:

Identify best-selling books and revenue drivers

Monitor and alert on low inventory stock

Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis

Measure marketing ROI for customer acquisition

Analyze customer retention and churn

Track monthly sales trends

Support data-driven decision making for stakeholders

## Tools and Technologies

SQL

SQL concepts:

Joins

Aggregations

Subqueries

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Date functions

The queries can be executed on SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL with minimal modifications.

Dataset Overview

The bookstore database consists of four interconnected tables that form a relational schema.

## Tables Description

Books

Stores book details including title, genre, price, and stock level

Customers

Contains customer information such as name, city, and signup date

Orders

Records purchase transactions linking customers and books

MarketingSpend

Tracks the cost incurred to acquire each customer

Primary and foreign key relationships ensure data integrity and enable multi-table analysis.

## Key Analyses Performed
Book Performance Analysis

Total units sold per book

Total revenue generated per book

Identification of top-selling and highest-revenue titles

Inventory Monitoring

Detection of books with low stock levels

Identification of understocked bestsellers

Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

Recency: Time since last purchase

Frequency: Number of orders placed

Monetary: Total revenue generated by each customer

This segmentation helps identify high-value and loyal customers.

Marketing ROI Evaluation

Comparison of customer lifetime revenue with marketing acquisition cost

Calculation of profit per customer

Assessment of marketing efficiency

Sales Trend Analysis

Monthly revenue tracking

Identification of seasonal patterns and growth trends

Customer Retention and Loyalty

Identification of returning customers

Detection of churned customers based on inactivity

Average Order Value (AOV)

Measurement of average revenue generated per order

Product Association Analysis

Identification of books frequently bought together

Useful for recommendations and bundle promotions

## Key Insights

A small group of customers contributes significantly to total revenue

Best-selling books are sometimes understocked, risking lost sales

Customers with higher purchase frequency tend to buy mid-priced books

Marketing spend shows positive returns for most customers

Repeat customers indicate strong engagement and loyalty

Cross-selling opportunities exist through frequently bought-together books


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used to perform end-to-end analytics for a retail bookstore. By combining transactional data with customer and marketing information, the analysis provides valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, inventory management, and marketing effectiveness. The approach showcased here can be easily adapted to real-world retail and e-commerce scenarios.
